# 9. VIRUS OPTIMIZATION**

For a virus to be lethal there are two characteristics: infectivity and death rate. Let us consider a network represented by a undirected graph. Starting from a random node the infection spreads across the network. Since the number of virus in the human body follow an exponential evolution as 𝑁𝑡=𝑁+∞(1−𝑒−𝜆𝑡), it is reasonable to assume that if person i has been infected at time 0, the probability of infecting each neighbour is defined as: 𝑝𝑖=𝛼𝑖(1−𝑒−𝜆𝑡 )while the probability of his death is 𝑞𝑖=𝛽𝑖(1−𝑒−𝜆𝑡) where both 𝛼𝑖 and 𝛽𝑖 are distributed according to a normal distribution. We consider three states for the node: healthy, contagious and ill. A person is healthy if she does not have any virus. We consider a person to be ill if 1−𝑒−𝜆𝑡≥ℎ. The parameter h can be interpreted as the viral quantity that makes a person to feel sick.  If a person is ill it is removed from the network and if he/she survives for T time steps he/she is considered cured, otherwise he/she is considered death. Given the network, 𝛼𝑖, 𝛽𝑖 ∀𝑖, h and T, what are the value of 𝜆that kills the greatest amount of people? How do these characteristics vary in relation to the network characteristics (e.g. closeness centrality, average degree, standard deviation of the degree, etc.) and to h values?
